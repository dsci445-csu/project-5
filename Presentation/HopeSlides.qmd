## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Linear Regression

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
lasso_terms <- read.csv("../Code/LinearRegressionOutputs/lasso_terms.csv")
lasso_terms[,c("term", "estimate")]
```

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
